## Change to developer support (Febuary 4, 2022)

Not a new release, per se, but we have migrated support from GitHub Issues in this repository to our customer support team.

## 2.1.2 Release (November 19, 2020)

##### Features

* [HSBeacon handleWillPresentNotification: completion:] now returns a BOOL to indicate if Beacon called the completionHandler. [Issue 104](https://github.com/helpscout/beacon-ios-sdk/issues/104)

## 2.1.1 Release (November 9, 2020)

##### Features
* Customers now have a similar experience with Beacon on all platforms: web, Android, or iOS. [Issue 67](https://github.com/helpscout/beacon-ios-sdk/issues/67)
* Customizing the [focusMode](https://docs.helpscout.com/article/1296-work-with-beacon-modes) configuration value at the SDK or the Beacon config level allows you to change the SDK's behavior and appearance for your users.
* Beacon now uses the PHPicker when attaching images and videos on iOS 14. Beacon no longer requests permission to the user's photo library when attempting to attach photos or videos. [Issue 119](https://github.com/helpscout/beacon-ios-sdk/issues/119)

* `HSBeaconMessagingSettings.showGetInTouch` & `HSBeaconMessagingSettings.showGetInTouchSet` have been deprecated as they're no longer applicable in Beacon 2.1.
* `HSBeacon.login` has been deprecated in favor of `HSBeacon.identify`. The method parameters have not changed, so replacing calls to login with identify is the only necessary change.


## 2.1.0 Release (October 29, 2020) - Removed

We discovered an issue where under some Beacon configurations the Beacon SDK could not be dismissed.  Because of this we have removed 2.1.0 and will resolve those issues before publishing a new release. Please use 2.0.2 in the mean time, thank you for your patience.

* If `emailTranscriptionEnabled` is false, we won't display a message saying we will send your chat transcript to you in an email when the chat ends. ([Issue 87](https://github.com/helpscout/beacon-ios-sdk/issues/87))).
* If `enablePreviousMessages` is set to false on your `HSBeaconSettings` object, Beacon will no longer display a message about viewing previous conversations when a chat ends.
